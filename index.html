					<p>DrinkSafe is an ESSEC Startup founded in March 2022, created in order to allow students to party in a safe and responsible manner. Created by a group of inspired students, DrinkSafe has one goal: to let the young people enjoy their party life without the fear of getting spiked. Spiking refers to the act of putting any substance, whether it is alcohol or drugs in someone's drink without their consent. After acknowledging the risks and the widespread of such practices, we decided to be the solution.</p>

					<p>DrinkSafe aims to improve parties and nightclubsâ€™ safety, raising awareness on spiking, and letting young people express themselves and live their lives at their fullest. The purpose of DrinkSafe is to produce a plastic lid that can be placed on any cup (the lid has an elastic band which helps it to fit on any drinking vessel) in order to prevent spiking.</p>
